Module "usb_device" (component Usb_Device)
   - usb_device_USB_Class_Init -The function initializes the Class Module
   - usb_device_USB_Class_DeInit -This function De-initializes the Class Module
   - usb_device_USB_Class_Send_Data -This function calls the device to send data upon receiving an IN token
   - usb_device_USB_Class_Periodic_Task -This funtion calls for periodic tasks
   - usb_device__usb_device_init -This function initializes the Device layer and the Controller layer of the S08 USB stack. It 
                initialised the variables used for this layer and then calls the controller layer initialize function
   - usb_device__usb_device_deinit -This function de-initializes the Device layer and the Controller layer
   - usb_device__usb_device_init_endpoint -This function initializes an endpoint the Device layer and the Controller layer in 
                the S08 USB stack. It validate whether all endpoints have already been initialized or not and then calls the 
                controller layer endpoint initialize function
   - usb_device__usb_device_deinit_endpoint -This function deinitializes an endpoint the Device layer and the Controller layer 
                in the S08 USB stack. It validate whether all endpoints have already been deinitialized or not and then calls 
                the controller layer endpoint deinitialize function
   - usb_device__usb_device_get_status -This function retrieves the endpoint as well USB component status which is stored by 
                calling USB_Device_Set_Status. This function can be called by Application as well as the DCI layer.
   - usb_device__usb_device_set_status -This function sets the endpoint as well USB component status which can be retrieved by 
                calling _usb_device_get_status. This function can be called by Application as well as the DCI layer.
   - usb_device__usb_device_register_service -This function registers a callback function from the application if it is called 
                not already registered so that the regitered callback function can be if the event of that type occurs
   - usb_device__usb_device_unregister_service -This function un registers a callback function which has been previously 
                registered by the application layer
   - usb_device_USB_Device_Call_Service -This function calls the registered service callback function of the application layer 
                based on the type of event received. This function is called from the DCI layer.
   - usb_device_USB_Framework_Init -This fuction registers the service on the control endpoint
   - usb_device_USB_Framework_DeInit -The funtion De-initializes the Class Module
   - usb_device_USB_Framework_Reset -This function is used to reset the framework module
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Bus_Reset_Handler -This functions is called when USB Bus Reset event is received on USB Bus.This 
                function clears all the errors conditions and reinit Global data structures. Also resets USB device controller.
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Init -This function initializes the Controller layer
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_DeInit -This function de-initializes the Controller layer
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Init_EndPoint -This function initializes an endpoint and the Bufffer Descriptor Table entry associated 
                with it. Incase the input parameters are invalid it will return USBERR_EP_INIT_FAILED error.
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Deinit_EndPoint -This function un-intializes the endpoint by clearing the corresponding endpoint 
                control register and then clearing the bdt elem.
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Cancel_Transfer -This function cancels any pending Transfers which ahve not been sent
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Stall_EndPoint -This function stalls the endpoint by setting Endpoint BDT
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Unstall_EndPoint -This function unstalls the endpoint by clearing Endpoint Control Register and BDT
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Get_Setup_Data -This function copies Setup Packet from USB RAM to application buffer
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Get_Transfer_Status -This function retrieves the transfer status of the endpoint by checking the BDT as 
                well as the endpoint control register
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Recv_Data -This function retrieves data received data on a RECV endpoint by copying it from USB RAM to 
                application buffer
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Send_Data -This function configures Controller to send data on an SEND endpoint by setting the BDT to 
                send data.
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Assert_Resume -This function starts RESUME signalling and then stops it after some delay. In this delay 
                make sure that COP is reset.
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_Set_Address -This function configures Controller to send data on an SEND endpoint
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_OnDeviceSpeedDetect -This function is called after the device detects bus speed
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_OnDeviceSuspend -This function is called after the suspend condition is met
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_OnDeviceResume -This function is called after the resume signaling is done
   - usb_device_USB_DCI_OnDeviceSetupPacket -This function called after the setup packet is received into the internal buffer
